            A word from the artist: ""I wrote this during a lecture discussing the current state of the world. Well at least that's what I was discussing, god knows what the lecturer was on about. The song started with a list of factors of the country that made me mad and developed into just anything that was pissing me off. The final verse is from a man I met whilst at working in this bourgeois bar. He took me to a club where girls danced on the bar after I worked and bought £200's worth of drinks. He then told me about a prostitute he paid a lot for and how he was going to make his second million. I hated almost every moment of knowing him. "
