            A word from the artist: "I had had the lyrics for many months beforehand and they fitted perfectly with the space of the track. Well I will let you be the judge of that. The meaning was showing the dedication yet detriment that a relationship could cause. The spiraling sadness that follows a breakup, the juxtaposition between hatred and love and the adjustment away from that I suppose."
        </p>
        <H5>Clash Music -</H5><h6>"Musically, LUMER seem to play with pre-existing notions of space - the taut, claustrophobic arrangements are shot against the broader, more nuanced production."</h6>
        <H5>Yuck Magazine -</H5><h6>"‘The Sheets’ unfolds the sadness of a broken heart and the juxtaposition between hatred and love. The track unveils the sinister side of restless romance."
